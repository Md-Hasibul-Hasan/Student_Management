## Complete Workflow

Users can register with name, email, and password. After registration, the API sends a verification email containing both an activation link and an OTP, allowing the account to be activated through either method.

Users log in with email and password. If 2FA is enabled, the login process returns a temporary token and requires OTP verification before access and refresh tokens are issued. Users can enable, disable, and check 2FA status from protected endpoints.

The system also supports Google OAuth login and registration. Authenticated users can update their profile, request an email change, change password, reset forgotten passwords, review active sessions, inspect login history, log out from selected devices, log out from all devices, or permanently delete their account.

Sensitive operations are logged and protected with rate limits, account lockout rules, token blacklisting, session deactivation, and security notifications.



## Security Behavior

After logout:

- The refresh token is blacklisted.
- The user session is marked inactive.
- Session-aware validation prevents access with tokens tied to inactive sessions.

After password change:

- Existing sessions are revoked.
- Other devices are logged out.
- The user must authenticate again with the new password.

Account protection includes:

- OTP expiration
- OTP attempt locking
- Login rate limiting
- Account lockout after repeated failures
- Device, browser, OS, IP address, and user-agent tracking
- Security logging for sensitive authentication events




## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drf-custom-auth.git
cd drf-custom-auth
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser

```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_app_password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com

OTP_EXPIRE_TIMEOUT=600
MAX_WRONG_OTP_ATTEMPTS=5
OTP_LOCKED_UNTIL=600
PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT=600

MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5
ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT_DURATION=600

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id

LOGIN_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS=90
INACTIVE_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=30
TWO_FA_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

PostgreSQL configuration is included in `DRF_Auth/settings.py` as a ready-to-enable database block. Local development currently uses SQLite by default.

## Authentication Header

Protected endpoints require a bearer token.

Content-Type: application/json
```



## Cleanup Command

The project includes a management command for removing old authentication data and expired SimpleJWT tokens.

Dry run:

```bash
python manage.py cleanup_auth_tables --dry-run
```

Run cleanup:

```bash
python manage.py cleanup_auth_tables
```

Custom retention windows:

```bash
python manage.py cleanup_auth_tables --login-history-days 90 --inactive-session-days 30 --two-fa-log-days 30
```

The command cleans:

- Old `LoginHistory` records
- Inactive `UserSession` records
- Old `TwoFALog` records
- Expired SimpleJWT outstanding and blacklisted tokens
